# OASIS BI PRO - Barbershop Management System

## 🎉 AUTHENTICATION FIX COMPLETE!

This README documents the comprehensive fix applied to resolve all RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and authentication issues.

---

## 🔍 ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### ❌ Previous Issues:
1. **No separate admin login page** - Admin users were forced to use customer login page
2. **RLS policies too strict** - Causing "row-level security policy violation" errors during registration
3. **OAuth redirect issues** - Google OAuth wasn't redirecting based on user role
4. **Missing role verification** - No validation to prevent admins from logging in via customer login and vice versa

### ✅ What Was Fixed:
1. **✨ NEW: Separate Admin Login Page** (`/login/admin`)
   - Dedicated login page for administrators
   - Role verification to prevent wrong role access
   - Clear error messages when wrong account type is used

2. **🔐 Updated RLS Policies**
   - Created clean, non-recursive RLS policies
   - Proper permissions for authenticated users
   - Service role full access for server-side operations

3. **🔄 Enhanced OAuth Flow**
   - Role-based redirect after Google OAuth
   - Expected role parameter support
   - Automatic profile creation with correct role

4. **🎯 Improved AuthContext**
   - Support for expected role validation
   - Better error messages
   - Proper dashboard redirection based on role

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Apply RLS Fixes to Supabase

**CRITICAL: You MUST run this SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor first!**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qwqmhvwqeynnyxaecqzw/sql/new
2. Copy the entire contents of `RUN_IN_SUPABASE_SQL_EDITOR.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor and click "Run"
4. Verify success message appears

**What the SQL script does:**
- Drops all existing conflicting RLS policies
- Creates clean, working RLS policies for both `user_profiles` and `barbershop_customers` tables
- Sets up proper permissions for authenticated users and service role
- Fixes trigger function for new user creation

### Step 2: Test the Application

**Test Customer Flow:**
```bash
# Navigate to customer registration
1. Go to /register
2. Fill in customer details with phone number
3. Register successfully
4. Login at /login
5. Should redirect to /dashboard/customer
```

**Test Admin Flow:**
```bash
# Navigate to admin registration
1. Go to /register/admin
2. Enter admin secret key (contact founder)
3. Fill in admin details
4. Register successfully
5. Login at /login/admin
6. Should redirect to /dashboard/admin
```

**Test OAuth (Google) Flow:**
```bash
# Customer OAuth
1. Go to /register
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Authenticate with Google
4. Should redirect to /dashboard/customer

# Admin OAuth
1. Go to /register/admin
2. Verify admin secret key first
3. Click "Sign in with Google (Admin)"
4. Authenticate with Google
5. Should redirect to /dashboard/admin
```

## 🔑 KEY CHANGES SUMMARY

### 1. Separate Login Pages
**Before:** Single `/login` page for all users  
**After:** 
- `/login` - Customer login
- `/login/admin` - Admin login (with role verification)

### 2. Role-Based OAuth
**Before:** OAuth always created customer profiles  
**After:** OAuth respects expected role parameter:
```typescript
signInWithGoogle('admin')  // Creates admin profile
signInWithGoogle('customer')  // Creates customer profile
```

### 3. Enhanced Authentication
**AuthContext Updates:**
```typescript
// Old
signIn(email, password)

// New
signIn(email, password, expectedRole?)  // Validates role

User can register at /register (customers) or /register/admin (administrators).
```

## 🗺️ NAVIGATION MAP

### Public Routes:
- `/` - Home page
- `/login` - **Customer** login
- `/login/admin` - **Admin** login ✨ NEW
- `/register` - Customer registration
- `/register/admin` - Admin registration

### Protected Routes:
- `/dashboard/customer` - Customer dashboard (requires 'customer' role)
- `/dashboard/admin` - Admin dashboard (requires 'admin' role)
- `/dashboard/barbershop` - Barbershop management (requires 'admin' role)

## 🎯 AUTHENTICATION FLOW

### Customer Registration & Login:
```
1. User visits /register
2. Fills form with email, password, phone, name
3. System creates:
   - Auth user in auth.users
   - Customer record in barbershop_customers (if phone provided)
   - Profile in user_profiles with role='customer'
4. User can login at /login
5. Redirects to /dashboard/customer
```

### Admin Registration & Login:
```
1. Admin visits /register/admin
2. Enters secret admin key (verified via API)
3. Fills form with email, password
4. System creates:
   - Auth user in auth.users
   - Profile in user_profiles with role='admin'
5. Admin can login at /login/admin
6. Redirects to /dashboard/admin
```

### OAuth (Google) Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Continue with Google" on register/login page
2. System passes expected role to OAuth:
   - /register → role='customer'
   - /register/admin → role='admin'
3. After Google auth, callback checks:
   - Existing profile? Verify role matches expected
   - No profile? Create with expected role
4. Redirects to appropriate dashboard
```

## 🔐 RLS POLICIES EXPLAINED

### user_profiles Table:
```sql
- user_profiles_read_own: Users can read their own profile
- user_profiles_insert_own: Users can insert their own profile during signup
- user_profiles_update_own: Users can update their own profile
- user_profiles_service_role_all: Service role has full access
```

### barbershop_customers Table:
```sql
- barbershop_customers_read_own: Customers can read their own data
- barbershop_customers_insert_any: Any authenticated user can insert (for registration)
- barbershop_customers_update_own: Customers can update their own data
- barbershop_customers_service_role_all: Service role has full access
```

## 🐛 DEBUGGING TIPS

### If Registration Fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify RLS policies are applied in Supabase
3. Check Supabase logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure email confirmation is enabled/disabled as per settings

### If OAuth Fails:
1. Verify Google OAuth is configured in Supabase dashboard
2. Check redirect URLs match exactly: `{your-domain}/auth/callback`
3. Ensure OAuth provider is enabled for your project
4. Check browser console for OAuth errors

### If Wrong Dashboard Redirect:
1. Check user_profiles.role value in database
2. Verify AuthContext is loading profile correctly
3. Check browser console for redirect logs
4. Ensure no middleware is interfering with redirects
